# GDAX Market Manager #

Check GDAX market prices for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Etherium!

## What is GDAX? ##

GDAX (Global Digital Asset Exchange) is Coinbase's exchange trading platform. Think of it as the stock market for crypto currencies.

## How do I use it? ##

Open the APKs folder and install the APK directly. Its currently unsigned, but I will sign them in the future.
Or...
Import the project with Android Studio and compile it yourself!

## What can I do with this? ##

You can check market prices for certain currency combinations, like USD -> BTC or GBP -> LTC. Basically you can trade FIAT (government) money for digital cryptocurrencies and vice versa.

I am slowly adding more features, so stay tuned.
