# GDAX Market Manager #

Check GDAX market prices for crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Etherium!

## What is GDAX? ##

GDAX (Global Digital Asset Exchange) is Coinbase's exchange trading platform. Think of it as the stock market for crypto currencies.

## How do I use it? ##

[Click here for the latest APK](https://github.com/skr1p7k1dd/GDAXMarketManager/raw/master/APKs/app-debug-v0.1.apk). Its currently unsigned, but I will sign them in the future. Or you can import the project with Android Studio and compile it yourself!

## What can I do with this? ##

You can check market prices for certain currency combinations, like USD -> BTC or GBP -> LTC. Basically you can trade FIAT (government) money for digital cryptocurrencies and vice versa.

I am slowly adding more features, so stay tuned.

## What will you be adding in the future? ##

-Better looking UI

-Data persistance 

-Account options & settings

-Fancy graphs to help visualize market trends

-Live tracking from a websocket feed
